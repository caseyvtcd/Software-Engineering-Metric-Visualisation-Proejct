# Software-Engineering-Metric-Visualisation-Project

#### Installation

In order to run this project you must have installed the following:

- bokeh
- datetime
- pandas
- PyGithub

In order to do so you may use a pip install to easily acquire them. 
For example: 

``pip install pandas``

#### Running

In order to run the project you must enter your GitHub token into token.txt. One has been provided without a token in the project folder.

The easiest way to run the project is to navigate to the project folder in a terminal and type:

``python GithubAccess.py``

If you would like to alter the user and repository you are viewing, you may do so by editing the user.txt and repo.txt files.


#### The Project

This project calculates and graphs out how many commits per day a given user has over a period of time on a line graph, as well as show casing the proportion of languages they used in a pie chart and finally the users profile picture and username. I use and convert the datetime format to process the dates and times given by github repositories, extracted and compared the dates and counted the number of commits on each individual day. 


Unfortunately I did not have time to do more on the project because of the close proximity with exams and the sheer volume of work before Christmas.

#### Happy New Year
